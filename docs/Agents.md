This document describes all active agents in the Beyond ProcWise ecosystem, their responsibilities, key interactions, and configuration parameters.
It reflects the post–October 2025 refactor removing RFQ ID usage and standardizing on workflow_id.

🔁 Overview

Each agent in ProcWise follows a common pattern:

Input Context: Provided via routing (workflow_id, agent_name, supplier_id, round, status, payload).

Output Context: Persisted to Postgres (e.g., process details, drafts, session state) and optionally dispatched via the email chain.

Idempotency: All writes use ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE aligned with real unique indexes.

Locking: Agents that modify shared state (e.g., NegotiationAgent) use Postgres advisory locks to prevent duplicate executions.

🧩 Agent Catalog
Agent Purpose Inputs Outputs Dependencies
OpportunityMinerAgent Mines historical spend, contracts, emails, and embeddings to surface new sourcing/negotiation opportunities and supplier candidates. De‑duplicates by opportunity signature and routes to the orchestrator. Historical transactions, contract metadata, supplier catalogs, email corpus, embeddings, workflow_id Opportunity candidate list, suggested categories/suppliers, routing events qdrant_client, embedding service, spend/contract loaders
DataExtractionAgent Extracts tabular/semantic content from uploaded documents (PDF/DOCX/XLSX) and stores structured JSON & embeddings. Document path/type, workflow_id Parsed JSON + vector embeddings pdfplumber, fitz, OCR, qdrant_client
SupplierRankingAgent Scores and ranks suppliers using multi‑criteria evaluation (price, lead time, risk, terms). Supplier offers, policy weights, workflow_id Ranked supplier table + best supplier suggestion Policy engine & scoring utilities
NegotiationAgent Handles multi‑round negotiation logic. Determines counter‑offers, applies playbooks, and triggers drafting. One active run per (workflow_id, supplier_id, round) via advisory lock. Supplier proposals, policy thresholds, workflow_id Counter‑offer decisions, session state, multi‑supplier draft bundle EmailDraftingAgent, ProcessRoutingService
EmailDraftingAgent Generates structured/contextual emails (supports multi‑supplier bundle per round). workflow_id, supplier_id, session_reference, round, prompt/context HTML drafts stored in drafts table Template/Jinja, Ollama LLMs
EmailDispatchAgent Sends finalized drafts and records each dispatch in the dispatch chain. Draft details, workflow_id, supplier_id, session_reference Sent message + message_id recorded SMTP/SES, Postgres
EmailWatcherAgent Monitors inbound mail for supplier responses. Maps replies deterministically via message_id or embedded PROC‑WF‑* token. Raw emails, workflow_id Parsed responses, updated negotiation sessions Email libs, Postgres chain mapping
OrchestratorAgent Central controller coordinating agents according to workflow states in routing. Routing JSON Sequenced/parallel agent invocations ProcessRoutingService
RAGAgent Conversational retrieval‑augmented generation agent for policy and document questions. User query, session context, optional doc_type Human‑friendly answer text, follow‑up suggestions Qdrant client, cross‑encoder, phi4 LLM, policy extractor, static QA memory

Note: The OpportunityMinerAgent is upstream of sourcing/negotiation and can autonomously seed new workflows or enrich existing ones with candidate suppliers and demand signals.

Discovery: OpportunityMinerAgent and/or DataExtractionAgent surface candidate items and suppliers.

Negotiation: Capped at three rounds per supplier with human‑in‑the‑loop checkpoints.

Threading: Replies loop back deterministically to the same (workflow_id, supplier_id, session_reference).

⚙️ Database Keys & Constraints (canonical)
Table (concept) Unique Key Purpose
Negotiation Sessions (workflow_id, supplier_id, round) Session row per supplier per round
Negotiation Session State (workflow_id, supplier_id) Latest state for each supplier
Email Drafts (workflow_id, unique_id, supplier_id) Draft per supplier per workflow (per unique)
Email Dispatch Chain (workflow_id, supplier_id, unique_id) Maps outbound message_id + session_reference for threading
Routing (process) (workflow_id, agent_name, supplier_id, round) Prevent duplicate agent execution per supplier round
Opportunity Candidates (if persisted) (workflow_id, opportunity_signature) De‑dupe mined opportunities in a workflow (signature strategy defined by implementation)

If you persist opportunities, ensure the signature is stable (e.g., normalized category + spec hash + time window) to avoid duplicates.

🔒 Locking and Idempotency

NegotiationAgent advisory lock per (workflow_id, supplier_id, round):
SELECT pg_try_advisory_lock(crc32(f"{workflow_id}:{supplier_id}:{round}") & 0x7FFFFFFF);

All inserts use UPSERT matching real unique indexes to avoid UniqueViolation or InvalidColumnReference.

📨 Email Threading Chain
Step Source Target Key Columns
Draft Creation EmailDraftingAgent Drafts store workflow_id, unique_id, supplier_id
Dispatch Record EmailDispatchAgent Dispatch chain workflow_id, supplier_id, unique_id, message_id, session_reference
Reply Mapping EmailWatcherAgent Joins chain + drafts message_id or PROC‑WF‑* token → (workflow_id, supplier_id, session_reference)

Every outbound email appends a marker in the HTML:

<!-- PROCWISE_MARKER:TRACKING:{unique_id}|SUPPLIER:{supplier_id}|TOKEN:{token} -->

🧠 Retrieval‑Augmented Q&A (RAGAgent)

The RAGAgent is the conversational interface used by the ProcWise portal to answer ad‑hoc procurement questions. It operates a retrieval‑augmented generation pipeline built on Qdrant and a fine‑tuned phi4 model. Unlike other agents which perform discrete workflow tasks, RAGAgent synthesises context from multiple data sources and returns a human‑friendly summary to the user. The key components are:

static_policy collection – Contains company policies and procedures loaded from S3. These documents are public and require no masking. RAGAgent queries this collection by default for any policy‑related question and summarises the relevant clauses without exposing document identifiers or internal table names.

procwise_document_embeddings collection – Holds embeddings for purchase orders, invoices, quotes and contract documents. When retrieving from this collection, the agent strips supplier identifiers and document IDs from the context so the answer focuses on the substantive content.

uploaded_documents collection – Created when a user uploads files via the /document/embed-document endpoint. If documents are present in this collection for the current session, RAGAgent prioritises them over other sources so follow‑up questions relate directly to the uploaded material.

Static question/answer memory – A curated set of frequently asked questions with ideal answers. If a query matches one of these templates, RAGAgent returns the predefined answer in a semi‑formal tone instead of performing retrieval.

RAGAgent uses cross‑encoder re‑ranking and improved chunking to select only the most relevant sentences or paragraphs from the above collections. It then calls the phi4 model with a prompt that instructs the model to speak like a helpful colleague: concise, semi‑formal and empathic. Policy answers are formatted into clear sections (e.g., What You Must Do, What's Prohibited, Spending Limits, Approval Requirements, Examples, Exceptions) with bullet points for ease of reading. Continuation prompts such as “good, but be more detailed” are treated as follow‑up questions rather than feedback; pure positive or negative feedback triggers a brief acknowledgement. The previous learning collection has been removed from the retrieval pipeline to avoid leaking internal data.

🤖 Model Configuration (Ollama)

Agents discover installed local models via:

ollama list

Supported roster (graceful fallback handled in code/config):

qwen3:30b
mixtral:8x7b
phi4:latest
gemma3:1b-it-qat
gemma3:latest
mistral:latest
gpt-oss:latest
llama3.2:latest

By convention phi4:latest is configured as the default model for the RAGAgent and other chat‑oriented components. The agent’s prompt fine‑tunes phi4 to speak in a natural, semi‑formal tone and to summarise retrieved content with empathy and clarity. Other models remain available and can be selected per‑agent via configuration.

Tune preferred models per agent where relevant (e.g., drafting vs. extraction) and ensure environment hooks surface all required tags.

🧩 OpportunityMinerAgent Details

Role:
Proactively identifies sourcing/negotiation opportunities (e.g., expiring contracts, category consolidation, price variance, demand spikes) and proposes suppliers.

Core Steps:

Ingest & Embed: Pull spend/contract/email snippets; refresh or query embeddings via Qdrant.

Detect Opportunities: Rules + LLM heuristics (e.g., anomalous price bands, long‑tail consolidation).

Candidate Suppliers: Map items/categories to suppliers; enrich with performance/risk context.

De‑duplicate & Persist: Use an opportunity_signature; upsert candidates (optional table) and/or route directly.

Route: Post routing events to Orchestrator to trigger SupplierRankingAgent (and downstream flow).

Inputs:
Spend lines, contract metadata (end dates/renewals), catalog SKUs, historical quotes/emails, embeddings, workflow_id.

Outputs:

List of opportunities (category, items, suggested suppliers, rationale)

Routing payload for SupplierRankingAgent / NegotiationAgent

Optional persistence for audit/tracking (opportunity candidates)

Idempotency:

Upsert by (workflow_id, opportunity_signature) if persisted.

Avoid re‑routing the same signature twice.

📌 Implementation Notes

No RFQ identifiers are used; workflow_id is the canonical key across all agents and tables.

Ensure OpportunityMinerAgent can start:

As a workflow entry‑point (creating a new workflow_id), or

As an enrichment step inside an existing workflow (receiving workflow_id from routing).

When OpportunityMinerAgent proposes suppliers for a category, it should populate routing payloads that the SupplierRankingAgent can consume without additional normalization.
